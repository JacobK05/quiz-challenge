## Description

For this project I wanted to create quiz to challenge my knowledge and others who want to attempt the quiz. The quiz is  5 questions, when you start the quiz you will have 75 seconds to complete it or you lose. If you answer a question wrong 5 seconds will be subtracted. At the end the time remaining is your score. Ive learned many javascript skills along with web APIs to give the user interaction with the website.
